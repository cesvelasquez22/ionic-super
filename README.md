# Ionic super guide

Inspired by ionic-super starter template but upgraded.

An Ionic project with built-in components but not necessarily using only those ones. This project will be a life survival guide for most use cases for a real application that you maybe treat them in the past and you may feel upset for looking around the web for a solution in this framework.
